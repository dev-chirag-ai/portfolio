Hi, I’m Chiragpreet Singh (CP), a BCA student and aspiring web developer. With 93% in Commerce and a 6.8 CGPA in BCA, I’m focused on mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through hands-on projects. Passionate about technology, freelancing, and hard work, my goal is to secure impactful internships at top firms like BlackRock or Infosys.
